    <h2 id="sdlc">Software Development Life Cycle</h2>
    <p>The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software. The goal of SDLC is to minimize project risks through forward planning so that software meets customer expectations during production and beyond. This methodology outlines a series of steps that divide the software development process into tasks you can assign, complete, and measure.</p>
    <h2 id = "desc">Agile Description</h2>
    <p>The Agile SDLC is a software development methodology that emphasizes collaborative thinking, feedback-driven decision-making, and cyclical change. Under Agile, teams complete work in sprints work cycles lasting 1 to 4 weeks that allow frequent discussions about what's working and what's not.</p>
